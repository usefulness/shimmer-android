Shimmer for Android
</h1>


_Opinionated_ fork of https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android

## Quickstart

1. Add dependency to `build.gradle`
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.usefulness:shimmer-android-core:${{ version }}")
}
```

2. Use library

a) via xml
```xml
 <io.github.usefulness.shimmer.android.ShimmerFrameLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:shimmer_duration="2000"
    >

      <TextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Content"
        />
</io.github.usefulness.shimmer.android.ShimmerFrameLayout>
```

b) via code
```kotlin
val shimmerFrameLayout : ShimmerFrameLayout 
shimmerFrameLayout.shimmer = Shimmer(
    duration = 2000,
)
```
3. Done ðŸŽ‰
